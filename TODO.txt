Fix styling:
-play areas do not stay in the middle once the cpu runs out of cards in hand
-turn phases do not update after the first turn
-attack and defense sprites are not working
-images are not quite centered
-attack and defense need to be pushed into the lower corners

Fix functionality:
-game never ends (needs win condition check)

Extras?
-animations
-more pictures for cards
-abilities?
-strong against/weak against?
-eventually maybe we could choose to attack a particular enemy with a particular ally?
